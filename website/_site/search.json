But soon, we settled at Odisha’s capital city, Bhubaneswar, where I spent most of my schooling days till my 12th grade.\nI spent the next 5 years, 2016-2021, in another Indian state, Karnataka’s capital, Bengaluru for my Bachelors and Masters of Science degrees in Physics, at Indian Institute of Science.\nAfter that, I came to Munich in Bavaria, Germany for my Doctoral Studies at Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in nearby town of Garching."
