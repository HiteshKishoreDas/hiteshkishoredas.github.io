But soon, we settled at Odisha‚Äôs capital city, Bhubaneswar, where I spent most of my schooling days till my 12th grade.\nI spent the next 5 years, 2016-2021, in another Indian state, Karnataka‚Äôs capital, Bengaluru for my Bachelors and Masters of Science degrees in Physics, at Indian Institute of Science.\nAfter that, I came to Munich in Bavaria, Germany for my Doctoral Studies at Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in nearby town of Garching."

We use idealised MHD simulations run using Athena ++ for this study.\nDoctoral Advisor: Dr.¬†Max Gronke\nFormal supervisor: Prof.¬†Volker Springel\nMax Planck Institute for Astrophysics, Garching\n\n\nRole of temperature and metallicity in the evolution of thermal instability\n[ 1 AUG 2019 - PRESENT ]\nIn this project we investigate the role of different parameters like metallicity and temperature in the growth of thermal instability. The project includes setting up and running simulation for study of thermal instabilities using PLUTO.\nThis work led to some important insights into evolution of large-scale isochoric clouds.\nThis project contributed towards my Bachelors thesis and led to a research paper in collaboration with Dr.¬†Prakriti Pal Choudhury and Prof.¬†Prateek Sharma.\nUnder supervision of: Assoc.
