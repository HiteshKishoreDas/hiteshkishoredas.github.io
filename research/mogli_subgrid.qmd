Hi there!

In this page we show some of relevant visualisations from our paper about the subgrid model "MOGLI". The preprint version is now available on arXiv at [2412.03751](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03751).

These are only a subset of the visualtisation. Keep an eye on this page, for more content in a couple of weeks.

## MOGLI with 100 unresolved clouds

Here's a showcase of an application of MOGLI. A turbulent box with 64^3 cells, 100 unresolved clouds with the radius of L_box/256:

## Reduced MOGLI, and 1000 unresolved clouds

And here's a showcase of turbulent mixing of unresolved cold gas with a reduced version of MOGLI, where cold gas growth is turned off. 
It's a turbulent box with 64^3 cells, 1000 unresolved clouds with the radius of L_box/256:
