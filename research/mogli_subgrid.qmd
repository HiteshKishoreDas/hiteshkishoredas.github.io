Hi there!

In this page we show some of relevant visualisations from our paper for the subgrid model "MOGLI".
These are only a subset of the visualtisation. Keep an eye on this page, for more content in a couple of weeks.

Here's a showcase of an application of MOGLI. A turbulent box with 64^3 cells, 100 unresolved clouds with the radius of L_box/256:

And here's a showcase of turbulent mixing of unresolved cold gas with a reduced version of MOGLI, where cold gas growth is turned off. 
It's a turbulent box with 64^3 cells, 100 unresolved clouds with the radius of L_box/256:
