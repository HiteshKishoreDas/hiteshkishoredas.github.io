<!-- :::{.column-body-outset-right} -->


I am a fourth year PhD student at [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de) (MPA), Garching, which I joined under the [International Max Planck School (IMPRS) on Astrophysics](https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/) on Astrophysics at [Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU)](https://www.lmu.de/en/) (LMU), Munich.

I am part of [Dr. Max Gronke](http://max.lyman-alpha.com/)'s [Multiphase Gas Group](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/1020167/multiphase-gas) at MPA, where I am studying the effects of magnetic fields and turbulence on multiphase astrohysical mediums.

My broad research interest is **Computational Astrophysics**. To be more specific, I work with **(Magneto-)Hydrodynamic simulations** to study the behaviour of Astrophysical mediums.
