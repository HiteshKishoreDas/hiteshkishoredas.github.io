# Hi!

I'm an Astrophysicist with broad research interest in **Computational Astrophysics**. To be more specific, I work with **(Magneto-)Hydrodynamic simulations** to study the behaviour of Astrophysical mediums, especially the Circumgalactic medium.     
This includes looking into processes like **thermal instability**, **turbulence**, **magnetic fields**, etc.

Currently, I am part of [Drummond Fielding](https://dfielding14.github.io/)'s group at New York University as a **Postdoctoral Associate**. 
I recently defended my PhD thesis in [Max Gronke](http://max.lyman-alpha.com/)'s [Multiphase Gas Group](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/1020167/multiphase-gas) at [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de) (MPA), Garching.<sup>*</sup>

(<sup>*</sup>Max's Multiphase Gas Group has now [moved to ARI at Heidelberg university](https://zah.uni-heidelberg.de/de/aktuelles/news-detail-de/max-gronke-new-erc-research-group-leader-at-zah)).

<!-- I'm part of the [International Max Planck School (IMPRS) on Astrophysics](https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/) on Astrophysics at [Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU)](https://www.lmu.de/en/) (LMU), Munich. -->

All the contents are arranged into different tabs on the top navigation bar.

You can find the details of my academic research in the [**Research**](research.qmd) section.    
The [**Other Stuff**](other_stuff.qmd) section contains my other short and quick projects, my other hobbies or anything I find interesting and would like to share.   
<!-- And [**Blogs**](blog_list.qmd) section is (or will be) home to all other thoughts that I just want blurt out. -->
Finally, the [**About**](about.qmd) page is all about (you guessed it!) me. ðŸ˜„
