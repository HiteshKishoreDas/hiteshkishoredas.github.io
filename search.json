    "section": "",
    "text": "Hello there! üëã\nWe would like to introduce our recently published, MOGLI subgrid model for capturing multiphase gas dynamics!\nFollowing the age-old tradition of contrived Astrophysical abbreviation, MOGLI stands for MOdel for Multiphase Gas using MulLIfluid hydrodynamics.\nMultiphase gas, with hot (‚àº\\(10^6\\)K) and cold (‚àº\\(10^4\\)K) gas, is ubiquitous in astrophysical media across a wide range of scales. However, simulating multiphase gas has been a long-standing challenge, due to the large separation between the size of cold gas structures and the scales at which such gas impacts the evolution of associated systems.\nThis is where MOGLI comes into the picture. Implemented with multifluid AREPO, the model is based on first principles and theoretical results from previous studies with resolved small-scale simulations, leading to a minimal number of free parameters in the formulation.\nMultifluid methods have long been used for engineering applications for water-air interactions, combustions, and meteorolgy.\nIn this scheme, fluid properties like density, momenta and energy of multiple fluid are tracked on the same grid and the different fluids are tracked via their volume fractions in each cell. We build upon the implementation of multifluid methods in AREPO, showcased in this paper by Weinberger & Hernquist (2023).\nWe use the theoretical understanding from previous studies which use small-scale resolved simluations as the foundation of MOGLI. We divide the interactions between the hot and cold gas fluid in the model into three sources: drag, turbulent mixing and cold gas growth.\nWe verify the different components of the framework through extensive comparison with benchmark single-fluid simulations across different simulation parameters, such as how resolved the cold gas is initially, the turbulent Mach number, spatial resolution, and random initialisation of turbulence.\nWe find that MOGLI can reproduce behaviour like the cold gas survival criteria as an emergent property, without it being explicitly included in the model.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate its capability by running a simulation which would be computationally prohibitive to run as a resolved single-fluid simulation, and following are two such simulations.\nFor more about the details and verification of the model check our paper, now on arXiv at 2412.03751.",

    "text": "This project was part of my Bachelors thesis at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and was published on MNRAS (here).\nUnfortunately, the figures are not available in dark-mode. So, apologies to dark-mode users. ‚òπÔ∏è\nThermal instability has been long proposed as one of the sources for cold gas in different astrophysical media. There have been numerous studies on its evolution and behaviour, including effects of factors like magnetic fields, gravity, rotation, etc. Similarly, in this study we aimed to study the effects of metallicity variations on thermal instability, including the difference in non-linear evolution of thermal instability at different temperatures, in 1D.\nWe found that the growth rates of thermal instability does not explicitly depend on the metallicity. We compared the simulations with theoretical expectations from linear analysis and found a very good agreement in the limits where the theory holds.\n\n\n\nComparison between theoretical and simlated growth rates\n\n\nWhat we did find, was the existence of different temperature regimes, where isobaric (small-scale) perturbations and isochoric (large-scale) perturbations had different behaviour at a given temperture. There were three regimes: * I : Both isobaric (small-scale) and isochoric (large-scale) perturbations are stable * II : Both isobaric (small-scale) and isochoric (large-scale) perturbations are unstable * III : Isobaric (small-scale) perturbations are unstable and isochoric (large-scale) ones are stable\n\n\n\nThe different regimes in temperature\n\n\nRegion I of course does not lead to anything, but interesting behaviour occurs in region II and III.\nIn region II, isochoric perturbations take the lead, and the overall evolution seems isochoric and large-scale in nature. In region III, isobaric perturbations take the lead, and the evolution of small-scale perturbations is dominant.\nThis gives rise to a two different kinds of behaviour in presence of both large-scale and small-scale perturbations, depending on the regime that the temperature falls in.\nIn region III, the behaviour is akin to the shattering of a large-scale perturbations, while in region II the large-scale perturbations contracts monolithically.\n\n\n\nThe overview of what happens in different regimes",

This poses a dilemma for multiphase gas, which is also observed across wide scales, from solar to cluster environemnts. It has been shown that with radiative cooling, turbulence helps mixing of the different phases which can help in the survival of multiphase gas.\nBut, that is evidence from Radiative Turbulent Mixing Layer (TRMLs) simulations that mixing is suppressed in presence of magnetic fields. This can pose issue for the survival of multiphase gas. A concise summary of this dilemma is shown in meme below üòÑ. In this project, we attempt to solve this dilemma using a series of (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations.\nThis project is part of my PhD thesis at Max Planck Institute of Astrophysics, Garching.

    "text": "Hi there!\nIn this page we show some interesting visualisations from our paper ‚ÄúMagnetic Fields in Multiphase Turbulence: Impacts on Dynamics and Structure‚Äù (2307.06411).\nThe components, namely, Turbulence, Multiphase gas and Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in astrophysical media. But, there has been only limited work on the intersection of all three parts. This work was an attempt to broaden the understanding at this intersection. In particular, to look at how magnetic fields affect the growth and survival of multiphase gas in a turbulent medium.\nFor this study, we use two sets of simulations: Turbulent Radiative Mixing Layers (TRMLs) and turbulent boxes.\nBelow we show the different visualisations from these two simulations.",
