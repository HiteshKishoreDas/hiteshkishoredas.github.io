    "text": "This project was part of my Bachelors thesis at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and was published on MNRAS (here).\nUnfortunately, the figures are not available in dark-mode. So, apologies to dark-mode users. ☹️\nThermal instability has been long proposed as one of the sources for cold gas in different astrophysical media. There have been numerous studies on its evolution and behaviour, including effects of factors like magnetic fields, gravity, rotation, etc. Similarly, in this study we aimed to study the effects of metallicity variations on thermal instability, including the difference in non-linear evolution of thermal instability at different temperatures, in 1D.\nWe found that the growth rates of thermal instability does not explicitly depend on the metallicity. We compared the simulations with theoretical expectations from linear analysis and found a very good agreement in the limits where the theory holds.\n\n\n\nComparison between theoretical and simlated growth rates\n\n\nWhat we did find, was the existence of different temperature regimes, where isobaric (small-scale) perturbations and isochoric (large-scale) perturbations had different behaviour at a given temperture. There were three regimes: * I : Both isobaric (small-scale) and isochoric (large-scale) perturbations are stable * II : Both isobaric (small-scale) and isochoric (large-scale) perturbations are unstable * III : Isobaric (small-scale) perturbations are unstable and isochoric (large-scale) ones are stable\n\n\n\nThe different regimes in temperature\n\n\nRegion I of course does not lead to anything, but interesting behaviour occurs in region II and III.\nIn region II, isochoric perturbations take the lead, and the overall evolution seems isochoric and large-scale in nature. In region III, isobaric perturbations take the lead, and the evolution of small-scale perturbations is dominant.\nThis gives rise to a two different kinds of behaviour in presence of both large-scale and small-scale perturbations, depending on the regime that the temperature falls in.\nIn region III, the behaviour is akin to the shattering of a large-scale perturbations, while in region II the large-scale perturbations contracts monolithically.\n\n\n\nThe overview of what happens in different regimes",

    "text": "Multiphase gas in Magnetised, Turbulent medium\nMagnetic fields and turbulence are ubiquitous, with many observational evidences towards there presence in multiple systems. This poses a dilemma for multiphase gas, which is also observed across wide scales, from solar to cluster environemnts. It has been shown that with radiative cooling, turbulence helps mixing of the different phases which can help in the survival of multiphase gas.\nBut, that is evidence from Radiative Turbulent Mixing Layer (TRMLs) simulations that mixing is suppressed in presence of magnetic fields. This can pose issue for the survival of multiphase gas. A concise summary of this dilemma is shown in meme below 😄. In this project, we attempt to solve this dilemma using a series of (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations.\nThis project is part of my PhD thesis at Max Planck Institute of Astrophysics, Garching.
