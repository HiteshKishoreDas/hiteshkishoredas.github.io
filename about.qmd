I am a third year PhD student at [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de) (MPA), Garching, which I joined under the [International Max Planck School (IMPRS) on Astrophysics](https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/) at [Ludwig Maximilians University](https://www.lmu.de/en/) (LMU), Munich.

I am part of [Dr. Max Gronke](http://max.lyman-alpha.com/)'s [Multiphase Gas Group](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/1020167/multiphase-gas) at MPA.

My broad research interest is Computational Astrophysics. To be more specific, I work with (Magneto-)Hydrodynamic simulations to study the behaviour of Astrophysical mediums.

## Background

I am natively from the state of [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha) (ଓଡିଶା) in India. During my early years, I travelled around a bit inside India with my parents as they got posted at different places. But soon, we settled at Odisha's capital city, [Bhubaneswar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar), where I spent most of my schooling days till my 12th grade.

I spent the next 5 years, 2016-2021, in another Indian state, [Karnataka's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka) capital, [Bengaluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore) for my Bachelors and Masters of Science degrees in Physics, at [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/). 

After that, I came to [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich) in [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria), Germany for my Doctoral Studies at [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/) in nearby town of [Garching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garching).


## What else?

When I'm not blowing or stirring gas in a simulated box, I have a couple of hobbies that engage with. My hobbies include **Bouldering**, **hiking** on weekends at the nearby Bavarian Alps and playing **Guitar**.    
I also spend some of my free-time on **side-projects** which I might find interesting (this including adding content to this website).     
You can find more about these in the [Other Stuff](other_stuff.qmd) section of the website.
